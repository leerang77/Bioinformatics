# Bioinformatics_Coursera
Custom code written by me for the Coursera Bioinformatics Specialization courses.

There are six courses in the specialization, covering the following topics/algorithms:

### 1 - Finding Hidden Messages in DNA
  1.1 Finding/counting patterns in DNA string, accounting for limited mismatches/reverse complement
  1.2 Detecting skew in nucleotide frequency in DNA string
  1.3 Finding a shared motif from a set of DNA strings, allowing for mismatches
  	- Greedy search, Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling
  1.4. Final project: Finding transcription factor binding motif for MTB genes upregulated in hypoxia. 

### 2 - Genome Sequencing
