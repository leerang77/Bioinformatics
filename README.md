# Bioinformatics_Coursera
Custom code written by me for the Coursera Bioinformatics Specialization courses.

There are six courses in the specialization, covering the following topics/algorithms:

### 1 - Finding Hidden Messages in DNA  
  1.1 Finding/counting patterns in DNA string, accounting for limited mismatches/reverse complement  
  1.2 Finding a shared motif from a set of DNA strings, allowing for mismatches  
  	- Greedy search, Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling    

### 2 - Genome Sequencing
