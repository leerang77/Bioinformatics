# Bioinformatics_Coursera
Codes written by me for the Coursera Bioinformatics Specialization courses.

There are six courses in the specialization, covering the following topics/algorithms:

### 1 - Finding Hidden Messages in DNA  
  1.1 Finding/counting patterns in DNA string, accounting for limited mismatches/reverse complement  
  1.2 Finding a shared motif from a set of DNA strings, allowing for mismatches  
  	- Greedy search, Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling    

### 2 - Genome Sequencing  
  2.1 Implementation of de Bruijn Graph for assembling genome sequencing reads into contigs</br>
  2.2 Implementation of Branch-and-Bound algorithm for reconstruction of peptides from mass spectrometry data</br>

### 3 - Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes  
  3.1. Global sequence alignment using DAGs (the Manhattan problem)</br> 
  3.2. Local alignment</br>
  3.3. Linear-space sequence alignment (the middle edge problem)</br>   
  3.4. Multiple sequence alignment using DAGs</br> 

### 4 - Molecular Evolution
  Part 1 - Phylogenetic Tree Construction </br>
  4.1. Distance-based Phylogeny Construction </br> 
  4.2. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) Phylogeny Construction </br>
  4.3. Neighbor-Joining Method Phylogeny Construction </br>   
  4.4. Character-based Phylogeny Construction (Maximum Parsimony) </br> </br>
  Part 2 - Peptide identification from Spectral Vectors </br>
  4.5. Ideal spectral vector to peptide </br>
  4.6. Real spectral vector to peptide
